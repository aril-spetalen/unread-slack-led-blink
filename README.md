# unread-slack-led-blink
Blinkstick USB warning lamp for slack unread messages and mentions

Requirements: 

- a device with the ability to blink. I used a Blinkstick Nano, which has a simple node API.

- a slack account, and an added slack application

- the slack app token, set as SLACK_BOT_TOKEN in your environment.
